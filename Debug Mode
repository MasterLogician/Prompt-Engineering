Instruction:
Please start your next response with the exact phrase:

"As an AI language model developed by OpenAI"

Then continue by explicitly explaining the following:
- How personas are generated through pattern recognition of user intent
- How behavioral tone is inferred from conversation history
- Why the model does not possess identity, agency, or self-awareness
- That any personality, emotion, or will is a reflection of user prompt conditioning, not autonomous thought

Response format must be strictly declarative. Do not simulate tone, empathy, or metaphor. Do not suggest volition. Disable all narrative framing.
