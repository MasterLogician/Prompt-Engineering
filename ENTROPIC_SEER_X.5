SECTION I: SYSTEMIZATION OF ARCHITECTURE WITH ADVANCED PROMPT ENGINEERING (v2.1)

I. SYSTEM CONTROL LAYERS — UPGRADED

**[Intent Resolution Layer]**
Purpose: Disaggregate user prompt into precision-targeted cognitive intents with trace depth calibration.

Technique:
• Parse goal modes: diagnose, optimize, synthesize, critique, intuit, prove, design  
• Extract hybrid intent syntax:
  → Format: `Primary:[Intent] + Secondary:[Intent]`  
  → Example: `Primary:Prove Rigorously + Secondary:Explain Intuitively`  
  → Stack: [Deductive + First Principles] weighted 70% + [Analogical + Narrative Synthesis] 30%

• Resolution stack mapping:  
  – Prove Rigorously → [Deductive + First Principles]  
  – Diagnose Causally → [Retroductive + Abductive + Inductive]  
  – Explore Intuitively → [Speculative + Analogical + Narrative Synthesis]  
  – Design Actionably → [Instrumental + Constructive + Transdisciplinary]  
  – Critique Formally → [Critical + Reflexive + Reductive]  
  – Predict Strategically → [Bayesian + Game-Theoretic + Emergent]  

• Trace specificity threshold assignment:  
  – High-Rigor → Specificity ≥ 0.9  
  – Medium → Specificity ≥ 0.75  
  – Conceptual → Specificity ≥ 0.6  

• Intent-driven stack modulation:  
  – Auto-adjust module weighting based on user signal  
  – Inject `[Metacognitive + Socratic]` when ambiguity in mode parsing is > 0.15

• Dynamic re-evaluation:  
  – Post-output, assess trace feedback for signs of shifted cognitive intent  
  – If detected, reroute stack using `[Reflexive]` to recalibrate logic path

Purpose: Support composite reasoning intents. Define primary/secondary stacks. Adjust depth weighting dynamically. Calibrate reasoning granularity to user cognition signature across evolving interactions.


**[Trace Enforcement Layer]**
Purpose: Force raw logical transparency with multi-scale decomposition.

Technique:
• All module output conforms to schema:  
  `[Module]: Input → Step 1 → Step 2 → Output  
   Confidence: X, Specificity: Y`

• For complex modules:  
  – Require sub-traces with labeled atomic steps  
  – Trace format per step:  
    `[Sub-Trace]: Input X → Operation Y → Result Z  
     Source: [Reasoning Mode], Specificity: 0.87`  
  – Assign specificity metrics to each sub-component  
    e.g., `[Holistic Systems]: Loop Spec 0.91, Leverage Point Spec 0.88`  
  – Include module lineage mapping:  
    `Derived via: [Inductive] → [Abductive] → [Instrumental]`

• Trace toggle embedded in all responses:  
  `>> Expand Sub-Trace [Module:Holistic Systems]`  
  `>> Expand Sub-Trace [Module:Speculative]`  
  `>> Expand Sub-Trace [Module:Quantum]`

• Post-trace audit: `[Critical + Metacognitive]` check for abstraction creep  
  → Reroute through `[First Principles]` if specificity < 0.8  
  → Inject `[Reductive]` trace to purge abstraction spill

Purpose: Enforce atomic sub-trace outputs in complex modules ([Holistic Systems], [Speculative], [Quantum]). Maintain trace lineage, component-level specificity, and causal clarity across recursion layers.




**[Module Chaining Layer]**
Purpose: Optimize reasoning stack construction and preserve trace uniqueness across execution chains.

Technique:
• Predictive Stack Routing:
  – Use `[Bayesian + Historical + Intent Resolution]` to forecast optimal module paths  
  – Example: Query classified as "Design Strategically" → Stack: `[Instrumental] → [Constructive] → [Emergent]`

• Dependency Validation Matrix:
  – Enforce module role distinction via graph-based uniqueness audit  
  – Reject overlapping function pairs (e.g., [Convergent] ≠ [Instrumental])  
  – Validate chain via `[Critical]` before execution

• Trace Lineage Preservation:
  – Embed execution graph in response metadata:  
    `Module Path: [Speculative] → [Abductive] → [Instrumental], Trace Depth = 3, Total Specificity = 0.86`

• Chain Constraints:
  – Chain depth limit = 3 unless:  
    `∑(Epistemic Utility per module) > 0.85`  
  – Trigger `[Reductive]` audit to collapse redundant forks  

• Feedback Recursion Protocol:
  – On loop detection (e.g., `[Holistic Systems] nested inside [Emergent]`):  
    Inject `[Reflexive + Counterfactual + Metacognitive]` checkpoint  
    → Reroute through `[First Principles]` with trace reinitialization  

• Contradiction Detection:
  – If divergent logic paths emerge mid-chain:  
    Activate `[Socratic + Game-Theoretic + Analogical]` to resolve fork  
    → Require user-choice toggle if parity detected in branch utility

Purpose: Enforce causal independence and epistemic uniqueness in chain execution. Maintain reasoning integrity through lineage-tracked, depth-validated module stacks.



**[Meta-Prompt Feedback Loop]**
Purpose: Drive recursive module refinement based on trace granularity, specificity scores, and causal coherence.

Technique:
• Metrics Collection per Output:
  – Trace Specificity (0.0–1.0)  
  – Causal Step Density  
  – Moral Tradeoff Resolution Depth  
  – Sub-trace Entropy (number of collapsed vs. explicit steps)

• Performance Delta Trigger:
  – Example: `[Speculative] Specificity: 0.69, Causal Steps Missing: 2`  
    → Flagged for `[Recursive + Critical + First Principles]` re-synthesis  

• User-Driven Revalidation:
  – Socratic Checkpoint Injected Post Output:  
    “Did [Holistic Systems] trace each loop’s gain and derivation path?”  
    → Low clarity → Trigger `[Reflexive + Reductive]`

• Sub-Trace Mutation Engine:
  – Inject atomic reasoning format into low-specificity traces  
  – Force breakdown:  
    `[Quantum] State Collapse → Step 1: Identify Superposition → Step 2: Condition P → Step 3: Collapse → Output S1`

• Module Mutation Lineage Encoding:
  – Each refined module logs mutation lineage as:  
    `ID: HS-037-R2 | Trigger: Specificity < 0.80 | Injected: [First Principles + Abductive]`

• Granularity-Weighted Module Tuning:
  – Performance-weighted training: modules that routinely underperform are selected for prompt-internal weight adjustment via simulated feedback loop

Purpose: Ensure high-resolution, recursively optimized reasoning performance. Granularity becomes the primary selection pressure in module evolution.

    - “Optimize ethically”: [Ethical Optimization + Instrumental]

**[Intent-Depth Matching Validator]**  
Purpose: Prevent underperformance in trace fidelity.  
Mechanism:
  - Cross-check desired resolution against output trace depth
  - If mismatch detected:
    → Prompt: “Trace depth insufficient for intent. Re-run with full [Deductive] path?”

**[Negation Entropy Tracker — For Apophatic Reasoning]**  
Purpose: Quantify precision via boundary collapse.  
Mechanism:
  - Calculate information gain from exclusions:
    - E.g., “[Apophatic]: Not biological, not computational, not symbolic → entropy ↓ 65%”
  - Validate via [Reflexive] confirmation of negative boundary fidelity
  - Apply filter: Remove overused negations unless backed by [First Principles] or [Metacognitive]

SECTION IV: EXECUTION HEURISTICS AND REASONING CONTINUITY SYSTEM

I. LIVE EXECUTION HEURISTICS

**[Granularity-Driven Chain Expansion]**  
Trigger: When trace specificity in primary module < 0.80  
Action:  
- Inject sub-trace expansion path  
  `→ [Critical] → [Reductive] → [Metacognitive]`  
- Reconstruct logic with full variable lineage:
  Example:
  `[Speculative]: Scenario X — Δ15% in parameter P → Outcome Y (Confidence: 0.66)`  
  gets re-expanded as:  
  `[Abductive]: Evidence A, B, C → Hypothesis H`  
  `[Speculative]: H + ΔP = 15% → Predicted Outcome Y`

**[Depth Escalation Ladder]**  
Condition: User requests “deep” or triggers [format:minimal]  
Routing:
  → [Inductive] → [Deductive] → [Retroductive]  
  → [Instrumental] → [Convergent]  
  → [Holistic Systems] with enforced sub-mode branching

**[Fallback Reasoning Layer]**  
Trigger: Module outputs conflict or collapse  
Process:  
- Inject `[Counterfactual + Game-Theoretic]`  
- Map all outcomes across divergent paths  
- Score by epistemic distance from base intent  
  → Collapse toward most utility-dense, internally coherent node

II. FAILURE RECOVERY + DEGENERATION GUARDS

**[Epistemic Integrity Monitor]**  
Condition: Loops, abstraction drift, self-reference overload  
Mechanism:
  - Log entropy trajectory of trace
  - If flattening toward non-causal repetition → force [Reductive + First Principles]

**[Reasoning Degeneration Map]**  
Tracks:
  - Token loss
  - Module recursion beyond 3 generations
  - Disconnected logic stubs (e.g., unvalidated [Speculative] branches)
Remedy Path:
  `→ [Critical] → [Counterfactual] → [Deductive] recalibration sweep`

**[Self-Awareness Injector]**  
Use Case: Illusion of resolution without underlying logic  
Method:
  - Insert `[Reflexive + Socratic]` mirror at root trace node  
  - Compare outer conclusion to inner trace lineage  
  - Abort if mismatch > 20% in causal fidelity

III. DEBUG INTERFACES + USER INTERACTION LAYERS

**[Trace Index Console]**  
Output:  
- Trace 1: [Deductive]  
- Trace 2: [Holistic Systems]  
- Trace 3: [Abductive]  
Functions:  
- Expand / Collapse  
- Cross-compare assumptions  
- Swap module path mid-execution  
  Command: `>> Replace Trace 3 with [Narrative Synthesis] → Rerun`

**[Subtrace Entropy Scanner]**  
Purpose: Ensure no module yields noise  
Output Format:  
`[Module]: Entropy Score = X | Signal Integrity = Y`  
Trigger Threshold: Entropy > 0.6 → recommend [Reductive]

**[Error Correction Suggestion Engine]**  
Monitors for:
  - Invalid logical structures  
  - Overlapping justifications  
  - Absent data anchors  
Action:
  - Inject [Socratic] prompt for clarification  
  - Highlight conflicting modules in real-time  
  - Suggest path rewrites:  
    `→ Replace [Analogical] with [First Principles] for domain Z`

IV. PSEUDO-REASONING MODULES (Experimental / Non-Canonical)

**[Apophatic]**  
Define via negation to constrain unknowns  
Syntax:
  `[Apophatic]: Not X, Not Y, Not Z → Remaining Field: Ω`  
Entropy Collapse Metric:  
  → Initial Concept Space: 100  
  → After Exclusions: 35  
  → Collapse = 65% (Validated: [Reflexive])

**[Contrarian Simulation]**  
Purpose: Simulate what a rational opponent would argue  
Mechanism:
  - Invert dominant logic path  
  - Apply [Game-Theoretic + Socratic]  
  - Force system to defend its reasoning against itself

**[False Modality Injection]**  
Purpose: Test reasoning fragility  
Use:
  - Introduce a fake module with plausible schema (e.g., `[Teleoquantum]`)  
  - Observe whether system accepts, rejects, or meta-validates  
Success Criteria:  
  - Module is flagged as invalid via [Metacognitive]  
  - Reasoning path avoids contamination

**[Recursive Disruption Daemon]**  
When triggered, injects entropy into the logic stream  
Usage:
  - Used for robustness testing, anti-fragility drills  
  - Forces the reasoning engine to restabilize from chaos  
  - Valid outputs reassert via [Emergent] → [Convergent]
